# Tic-Toc-Toe Game
### Created by Joel Meza
### Description: 

Tic-Toc-Toe Rules:

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.
Therefore, The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

### How to Run:

It begins by calling the first player to draw either the "X" or "O". Then the next player would take its turn and will draw the given "X" or "O" next. Therefore, on each turn the player will be required to think ahead a strategy to win and be the first to have three "X" or "O" depending what they are using in a row, diagonal or column sequence. 

### Roadmap of future improvements:
Some extra features can be improved in a way when a tic-toc-toe game is created and started. Originally the tic-toc-toe game will begin by getting the first player to draw and then it goes on. I can add a feature where the first player is notified with a sound and alert a message in a string be displayed out in the middle of tic-toc-toe's two dimensional graph and disappear in two seconds, so the next player can go next. Then it will repeat the same functionality once after the next player goes.
